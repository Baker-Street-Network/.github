To install one of these modules, use the following command:
`git submodule add "https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/module-name" ./addons/module_name

A note on the `muk-web-theme` and the `base-accounting-kit`. Both of these have sub-folders, so you may want to check these out in their own addons folders, then include this in the Dockerfile's run command manually.

If you are moving a module from a repository to a Git submodule, you'll have to clean the index first:
`git rm -r --cached addons/module_name`

### Initializing an Instance
To create a new instance, follow the instructions in the [odoo-template repository](https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/odoo-template).
