## Accessing Backups
If you are routinely downloading and testing backups, check out our utilities repository: [Baker-Street-Network/utilities](https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/utilities) <br />
To simply browse backups and see availability, access the backup browser: https://backups.bakerstreet.network/backups (or, locally, http://192.168.55.135/backups, without auth)
For development backups, check out: https://dev-backups.bakerstreet.network, or, locally: http://192.168.55.251/backups.

Steelgrade is the in-house utility for running backups on our production systems. It is comprised of four parts:
- Steelgrade Backup: [Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-backup](https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-backup)
- Steelgrade Cleaner: [Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-cleaner](https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-cleaner)
- Steelgrade Mover: [Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-mover](https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-mover)
- Steelgrade Staging: [Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-staging](https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/steelgrade-staging)

## Initializing an Instance
To create a new instance, follow the instructions in the [odoo-template repository](https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/odoo-template).

## Module Groups
We have several collection of modules that we typically install on our hosted instances. Run all checkout scripts at the root the repository.

**Odoo Themes** This is the default Odoo theme:
```
git submodule add -b 18.0 https://github.com/odoo/design-themes addons/odoo/design-themes
```
**Essentials** This is a collection of modules that we developed internally that are used heavily. To add these to your instance:
```
git submodule add -b 18.0 https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/essentials addons/baker-street/essentials
```
**Open Essentials** These are modules that we find useful in Community installs. To checkout these:
```
git submodule add -b 18.0 https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/open-essentials addons/baker-street/open-essentials
```
**MuK Web Theme** This is a nice theme for community installs:
```
git submodule add -b 18.0 https://github.com/muk-it/odoo-modules addons/muk/odoo-modules
```
**Cybrosis Addons** Each night, we sync a small list of Cybrosis modules to our own clone:
```
git submodule add -b 18.0 https://github.com/Baker-Street-Network/cybrosis addons/baker-street/cybrosys
```
**OCA (e.g. web)** We also use many of modules from OCA:
```
git submodule add -b 18.0 https://github.com/oca/web addons/oca/web
```
**Odoomates Accounting** Odoomates offers a great accounting module. This is a nightly clone from their repository with only the applicable modules available:
```
git submodule add -b 18.0 https://github.com/odoomates/odooapps addons/odoomates/odooapps
```

If you are moving a module from a repository to a Git submodule, you'll have to clean the index first:
`git rm -r --cached addons/module_name`
